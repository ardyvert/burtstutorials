	<h2>Factors and multiples.</h2>
	<p>
	The number 10 can be divided by the number 5 without leaving a remainder.<br>
	The number 5 is a factor if 10 and the number 10 a multiple of 5.<br>
	A factor is a number that  can divide another number without leaving a remaimder.<br>
	A multiple is a number that can be divided by another number without leaving a remainder.<br><br>
	Examples.<br>
	Factors of 24 are: 2,3,4,6,8,12.<br>
	Factors oc 18 are: 2,3,6,9<br><br>
	Multiples of 2 are:4,6,8,10,12,14,16 etc<br>
	Multiples of 3 are:6,9,12,15,18,21 etc.<br>
	<h2>Prime factors.</h2>
	<p>
	A prime factor is a factor that is a prime number i.e it has only two factors,namely itsself and 1.<br>  
	Among the factors of a number exists prime factors.<br>
	Example.<br>
	2,3,4,6,8,12 are factors of 24.Among these 3 is a prime factor.<br><br>
	<h2>Expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.</h2>
	<p>
	This is a useful technique because it is used to find the highest common factor,HCF and the lowest common multiple,LCM of a set of numbers.<br>
	To express a number as a product of its prime factors:<br>
	1.Divide it by the smallest prime factor which leaves no remainder.<br>
	2.Use this factor successively on the result of the previous division until it starts leaving a remainder and move to the next prime factor which leaves no remainder.<br>
	3.Stop when the result becomes 1.<br><br>
	Example.<br>
	Express 36 as a product of its prime factors.<br><br>
	2|36<br>
	2|18<br>
	3|9<br>
	3|3<br>
	* |1<br>
36=2x2x3x3.<br><br>
Express 25 as a products of its prime factors.<br><br>
5|25<br>
5|5<br>
* |1<br>
  25=5x5<br><br>
  <h2>Highest common factor</h2>
  <p>
  To find the highest common factor of two or more numbers first express each number as a product of its prime factors.<br><br>
  Example<br>
  42 and 18.<br>
  42=2x3x7<br>
  18=2x3x3<br>
  Take the common factor<br>
  HCF=2x3<br>
         =6.<br><br>
  Find the HCF of 6,9 and 12.<br>
  6=2x3<br>
  9=3x3<br>
  12=2x2x3<br>
  HCF=3<br><br>
  <h2>Lowest common multiple</h2>
  <p>
  To find the LCM of two or more numbers first express them as products of their prime factors.<br>
  Example<br>
  LCM of 6,12and 18.<br>
  6=2x3<br>
  12=2x2x3<br>
  18=2x3x3<br>
  Take each number where its most common.<br>
  LCM=2x2x3x3<br>
          =36.<br><br>
